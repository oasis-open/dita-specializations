## OASIS TC Open Repository: dita-specializations

This GitHub public repository [dita-specializations](https://github.com/oasis-open/dita-specializations) was created at the request of the [OASIS Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA) TC](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/dita/) as an [OASIS TC Open Repository](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/) to support development of open source resources related to Technical Committee work.

While this TC Open Repository remains associated with the sponsor TC, its development priorities, leadership, intellectual property terms, participation rules, and other matters of governance are separate and distinct from the OASIS TC Process and related policies.

All contributions made to this TC Open Repository are subject to open source license terms expressed in [Apache License v 2.0](LICENSE.md). That license was selected as the declared [Applicable License](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/licenses) when the TC voted to create this Open Repository.

As documented in [Public Participation Invited](href="https://github.com/oasis-open/dita-specializations/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#public-participation-invited), contributions to this TC Open Repository are invited from all parties, whether affiliated with OASIS or not. Participants must have a GitHub account, but no fees or OASIS membership obligations are required.

## Statement of Purpose

This repository provides storage for DITA specializations that were developed by the DITA TC, but which are no longer part of the DITA standard.

Initially, this repository contains the grammar files for the following DITA 1.3 specializations:

1. Learning and training
2. Machinery task
3. Task requirements domain

This public development project has been started by the DITA TC, but will depend on participation from the larger DITA user community in order to maintain the specializations and keep them compatible with the latest release of the DITA standard.
